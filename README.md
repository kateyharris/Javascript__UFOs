# UFOs

## _**Overview**_ 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The assigment consists of a build of Danaâ€™s UFO Finder webpage with a dynamic table that provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria, date of the siting, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO, all at the same time. 

## _**Results**_
### Files:
- index.html for webpage rendering
- static/js/app.js as javascript used in filtering
- static/js/data.js as table data of all recorded sitings
- static/images/nasa.jpg as header background image
- static/css/style.css as styling and formatting for the webpage

- Filter

## _**Summary**_
In summary the UFO Finderwebpage is neat in that it allows for filtering for many things. There is room, however for improvement. The filter feature is case sensitive, and currenlty there is only data for the US, so the country filter is unneccessary. Perhaps updaging the filter formating, and hidding filters that have only one options.
